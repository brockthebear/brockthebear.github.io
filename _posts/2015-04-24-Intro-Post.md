#### Hi, so um…yeah, I’m Brock and this is my blog.﻿


Let me start off by <del>saying</del> warning all of you that I have no credentials whatsoever to be a writer.

Seriously. I didn’t even get into my elementary school’s Gifted & Talented program because I wasn’t “creative” enough.

(If you can’t already tell, my 8-year old ego took quite a hit and never fully recovered). 



But I digress. 



I have wanted to start a blog for quite a while but I’ve just never quite gotten around to it. I feel like starting a blog is the millenial’s version of writing that novel they’ve always wanted to write or finally learning that new language. But, being a recent college graduate working only ~10 hours a week, you’d be surprised at how much free time I have on my hands(1).



So, here is my first blog post. I would be lying if I said I had decided on a niche for my blog. Maybe one day this page will be dedicated to a specific topic, but not right now. I plan on writing on a variety of topics, and I am sure science/technology material will work its way in frequently. Who knows, maybe I will even write a movie review or two. If you all are lucky maybe I’ll even find time to write that piece about ethics in video game journalism that I know everybody has been itching to read(2).





Ideally, this blog will turn into a page where I can document my thoughts and offer my take on a given topic, as well as serve as a pseudo-resumé in the sense that I will constantly be updating this site with new skills that I am learning and developing. For example, I have recently taken up web design and front-end development (basically the aesthetics and usability of a website), so I will be posting updates of my progress learning new languages and technologies and posting demos of those skills when possible. In fact, I’ve designed this very website from scratch, so this post could be viewed as the first demonstration of my web design skills. 



If there is a certain topic or subject that you want to know more about and think would make for a good blog post, just email me at brockborenpro@gmail.com and I’ll look into it.
